# Notes 1/28

**Five Number Summary** is *min, max, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd quartiles*

### Challenge

Number of variables: 16

Number of observations: 248

Number of countries: 248

Densest country: Macau

# Notes 1/30

``` R
file2 <- file.choose()
d2 <- read_csv(file2, col_names = TRUE)
d2$population
d2$area
d2$density <- d2$population / d2$area
d2 <- d2 %>%
  arrange(desc(density))
##requires read_csv to work properly
```

Important to understand the difference between a **data frame** (data arranged into a two dimensional table)and a **tibble** (list of vectors)

-   Tibbles don't work with as many functions as data frames, so those may cause more errors. However, certain functions work only on tibbles

    -   Most sub-setting works on both though

-   Tibbles are more manageable for working with in general (Tony's preference)

Useful functions for getting a grasp of the data you just freeking imported

``` R
head()
tail()
colnames()
rownames() ##only works with df
str()
glimpse()
dim()

attach() #allows R to know which variable you are referring to without specifying the data frame
with() #accomplishes a simular goal
```

Summaries for variables

``` R
summary() #gives the 5-number summary for each variable plus its class & mode if applicable
skim() #more cleaned up version of summary()
```

Boxplots & Sexy Boxplots (stripplots)

``` R
boxplot(log(d3$Body_mass_female_mean))
stripchart(log(d3$Body_mass_female_mean),
           method = "jitter",
           col = "blue",
           vertical = TRUE,
           add = TRUE)
boxplot(log(d3$Body_mass_female_mean) ~ d3$Family)
stripchart(log(d3$Body_mass_female_mean) ~ d3$Family,
           method = "jitter",
           col = "blue",
           vertical = TRUE,
           add = TRUE)
```

ggplot2 and its mysteries

``` R
p <- ggplot(data = d3,
       aes(x = "", y = log(d3$Body_mass_female_mean))) + 
  geom_boxplot(na.rm = TRUE) + 
  geom_jitter( color = "blue", width = 0.1)
```
