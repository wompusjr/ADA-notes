# Notes 1/28

**Five Number Summary** is *min, max, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd quartiles*

### Challenge

Number of variables: 16

Number of observations: 248

Number of countries: 248

Densest country: Macau

# Notes 1/30

``` R
file2 <- file.choose()
d2 <- read_csv(file2, col_names = TRUE)
d2$population
d2$area
d2$density <- d2$population / d2$area
d2 <- d2 %>%
  arrange(desc(density))
##requires read_csv to work properly
```

Important to understand the difference between a **data frame** (data arranged into a two dimensional table)and a **tibble** (list of vectors)

-   Tibbles don't work with as many functions as data frames, so those may cause more errors. However, certain functions work only on tibbles

    -   Most sub-setting works on both though

-   Tibbles are more manageable for working with in general (Tony's preference)

Useful functions for getting a grasp of the data you just freeking imported

``` R
head()
tail()
colnames()
rownames() ##only works with df
str()
glimpse()
dim()
```
